                    <p>As the only feeder school into the nationally recognized team at Mason High School, which took the <strong>1st place </strong>spot at the National Science Olympiad competition in 2021,&nbsp;&nbsp;the MMS Science Olympiad team has always been aspiring to reach the most prestigious heights we can. The MMS team broke all previous Mason records with 3rd place in Ohio in 2021.<br><br>Sponsorships would allow team members to acquire the highest quality of materials, and give them opportunities to experiment more with design choices, increasing our chances of winning a bid for the National tournament in 2022. <br><br>In addition, certain donations will guarantee your company’s logo a spot on our team shirt. and website. As our ranks in competitions rise, so will the promotion of your company. Having you sponsor our team would also cover the costs of additional invitationals and their added costs from transportation, hotels, etc. -- which are perhaps the most important way for us to practice and prepare for the Regional, State, and National competition. With your support and sponsorship, we believe our team’s hard work and extreme dedication will take us to even greater levels of achievement.<br><br>Funds donated by your company will cover the costs of competition registration, for both local and nation-wide invitationals, which typically cost up to $100 per team; typically, some of the top teams in the nation attend 6 or more invitationals a year with 2 teams! They will also cover the expenses that go into our building endeavors, from tech and inquiry machines to purchasing wood for constructing trebuchets, all of which can be very costly over the year-long season. These projects are a long-term commitment, and with design revisions, testing, and rebuilding, our members ensure that their best efforts are being put forth at competitions. In past seasons, our team has generally struggled with funding our builds and hasn’t been able to attend many invitationals -- however, your support can enable us to do so.<br><br></p>
